# Introduction to AI Group 1 capstone project

Game theory is a branch of mathematics used for typical strategic interaction be-
tween different players (agents). Game theory has been a large field of Artificial In-
telligence, an exciting subject to study and easy to present. In our project, we are trying to
solve the 2048 game â€“ a stochastic and partially observable environment by applying
minimax alpha beta pruning algorithm.
